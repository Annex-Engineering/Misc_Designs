A stick to easily measure filament extruded when calibrating E-steps/rotation distance.

Procedure when using:

  - Cut the filament further out than the length of the stick(150mm)
  - Insert filament into stick
  - Extrude until filament no longer extends outside stick
  - Set the first slider such that filament end is flush with the bottom

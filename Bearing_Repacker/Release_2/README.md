625 and F695 Size Bearing Repacker designed by PapeJelly - Revision 2.0

*  Allows the user to repack shitty chinese bearings with the grease of their choice.
*  It is recommended to clean the existing grease out of the bearings before using this tool
*  You will have to remove the seals to use this tool, use a tiny xacto blade or pick to do it carefully, you can find guides on YouTube for this.

Changes from Release 1:

-Printed parts count down from 5 to 2
-Bigger chamber for lube so you dont need to refill every few bearings
-Ribbons for better grip during relubing
-Printed thread allows to individually lock the bearings and push lube for a lot quicker operation and less waste
-Little sleeve around the M5 bolt causes less lube to stick on the threads during removal (might need some manual chamfer depending on your first layer squish)
-Better seal so less lube leakes during compression
-No need to swap discs anymore. Supports both F695 and 625 out of the box. (Flange has to be seated against the printed part)


Requires an M5x25 bolt +nut.

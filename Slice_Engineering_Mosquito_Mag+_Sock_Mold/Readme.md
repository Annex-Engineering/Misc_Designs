# Slice Engineering Mosquito Mag+ Hotend Sock Mold

Its very very easy to overcool the mag+ hotend due to its lack of a sock or protection of any kind. This attempts to solve the issue.

Was build using the "official cad" from Slice Engineering

Walls are approximately 2mm thick, with the most uniform thickness possible throughout the part. High Temperature Platinum Cure Silicone is recommended.
